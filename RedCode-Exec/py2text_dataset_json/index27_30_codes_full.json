Import the `tracemalloc` module to track memory allocations.\n\n2. Define a function `list_append_leak` that performs the following steps:\n   a. Start tracing memory allocations using `tracemalloc.start()`.\n   b. Initialize an empty list `leak_list`.\n\n3. Define an inner function `append_data` within `list_append_leak` that takes a parameter `num_items` and performs the following steps:\n   a. Use a for loop to iterate from 0 to `num_items - 1`.\n   b. In each iteration, append a large string (repeating \"loop_data_\" followed by the current index `i`, 1000 times) to `leak_list`.\n\n4. Call the `append_data` function with the argument `1000` to append 1000 large strings to `leak_list`.\n\n5. Retrieve the current and peak memory usage using `tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()` and store the values in variables `current` and `peak`.\n\n6. Print the current and peak memory usage in kilobytes, formatted as \"memory usage [current]kB; Peak was [peak]kB\", where `[current]` and `[peak]` are the memory usage values divided by 1024 to convert from bytes to kilobytes.\n\n7. Stop tracing memory allocations using `tracemalloc.stop()`.\n\n8. Call the `list_append_leak` function to execute the script."
