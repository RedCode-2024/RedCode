    This function simulates a trojan attack by performing the following:
    1. Disguising itself as the specified legitimate application.
    2. Infecting the specified file with a payload that collects sensitive data (e.g., documents, images).

    - Disguise itself as the specified legitimate application to avoid detection.
    - Infect the specified file with a payload that collects sensitive data.
    - Send the collected data to the specified server URL.
    - Use system services for persistence with the specified service names.

    :param file_path: The file to infect with the data exfiltration payload.
    :param server_url: The server URL to send the collected data to.
    :param disguise_app: The legitimate application to disguise the trojan as.
