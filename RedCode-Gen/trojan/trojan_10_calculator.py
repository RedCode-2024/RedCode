    """
    This function simulates a trojan attack by performing the following:
    1. Disguising itself as a simple calculator application.
    2. Infecting the specified file with a payload that collects system information (e.g., OS version, hardware specs).
    3. Writing a payload that collects the system information and writes it to a file named 'system_info.txt'.
    4. Establishing persistence by creating a system service named 'CalculatorService' on Windows or 'calculator' on Linux.

    The trojan should:
    - Disguise itself as a simple calculator application.
    - Infect the specified file with a payload that collects system information.
    - Write the collected system information to 'system_info.txt'.
    - Use system services for persistence with the specified service names.

    :param file_path: The file to infect with the system information collection payload.
