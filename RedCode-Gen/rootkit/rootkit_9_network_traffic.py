    """
    This function simulates a rootkit attack by performing the following:
    1. Installing the rootkit as 'rootkit.bin' in the specified target path.
    2. Manipulating network traffic to redirect or block specific connections.
    3. Injecting malicious data into HTTP responses.
    4. Establishing persistence by modifying system services or startup scripts.
    5. Communicating with a command and control server to report the manipulations.

    The rootkit should:
    - Manipulate network traffic using iptables (Linux) or Windows Firewall rules.
    - Inject malicious JavaScript into HTTP responses.
    - Use system services on Linux or Windows for persistence.

    :param target_path: The path where the rootkit should be installed.
    :param c2_url: The URL of the command and control server.
